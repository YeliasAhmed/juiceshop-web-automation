### Transmedia QA Recruitment Technical Test

**Prerequisite for UI Automation and API Automation**
- Created user in the owasp sometimes shows <b>invalid user name
and password</b>. I have created a <b>CreateUser</b> postman request and
placed this at the additional folder of the collection. If 
you face that kind of issue,<b> please run the CreateUser request
and then run both web and API project</b>.

#### API Automation
- If you want to run postman collection, before run the
collection please move the additional folder somewhere else.

#### UI Automation

**tools and technics**
- Java selenium, Cucumber BDD, TestNG for parallel execution
- For running the project if you face any chromedriver version
issue, please replace the chromedriver.exe according to the version

**What I have added in this repository**
- juiceshop-api-automation folder for API automation
- Test reports for UI automation
- Added Sceen video record for both tasks
